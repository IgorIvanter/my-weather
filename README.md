# Description

This is a weather app. This is my first project where I used React.js and API requests. When you search for a city, only cities with population greater than 0.5M people will be displayed. Information about the weather is from openweathermap API.

# What I learned

- Basics of React: components, built-in and custom hooks, conditional rendering, context, data flow via props, rendering multiple components using Array.map(), inline styling, JSX and how it's transpiled to JS, etc.

- Requests using 'fetch()', promises

- Handling request being sent too often, setting timeout between requests, aborting old requests

- Extracting components and functions into separate files

- Working with unix timestampes and Date() object
